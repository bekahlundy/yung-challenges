## Welcome to the challenges dojo!

Today we're going to be working on some algorithmic thinking.
The goal of this exercise is to see if you can use some logic to
solve some of these yung-problmes


### Problem 1

I want you to create a function called `arrayRange` that takes a starting range and a length. So when I call the function like this `arrayRange(1,5)` it returns `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

## Problem 2

Jhun has some really weird lingo. Some would even question if he's fit to be an actual instructor. Here's an array of words that Jhun typically says

```
['lit', 'fam', 'suh', 'dude', 'dude', 'suh', 'lit', 'lit', 'lit', 'fam', 'suh']

```

I would like for you to create a function called `yungTally()`. When this function is called it will return a javascript object that tallys the number of times each word occurs.

`{lit: 4, fam: 2, suh: 3, dude: 2}`

## Problem 3

Array's are hard. Array's inside array's are even harder. Let's make it so you only deal with one! You'll be starting with a nested array `[1, [1,2],[3,[4,5]]]`. What I'd like you to do is write a function called `flatten`. This function will take that nested array and output a single array. `[1,1,2,3,4,5]`
